## Systems Final Project: UNO

### Project Members

Celine Yan and Jiawei Chen (Both in Period 5)



### How to compile

1. In terminal, run `make`
2. run `make run` 



### Things to keep in mind

- Like the typical UNO, players can place down cards. Our game is *case sensitive* when putting down cards or calling a command.
  - Cards must be in **UPPERCASE**
  - Commands must be in **lowercase**
- User must type in the command `pass` to move to the next player's turn.
